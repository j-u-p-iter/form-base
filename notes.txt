Each package contains package.json file.

In dependencies field this package contains all dependencies necessary to work 
with project after installation.
This field tells - to work properly with this package you need to install this packages with exact this versions.compileToESLogger
Dev dependencies contains packages, that is necessary to develop this package.
Here you cann see react, redux and others. It's runtime dependencies. And according to this they should be in dependencies field.
But this is global dependencies. It means that one project can have only one react and one redux dependency.
And all installed dependency can have only this version.
Project can't have multiple react, redux, react-router packages. Only single.

So, in documentation for package we tell the user - hey, it works only with react >= 16.0.0.
But we don't publish this dependency to npm.

Only project-specific dependencies goes with this package.

Like react-router with react-router-redux.

React, Redux should be event peerDependencies.

Packages, that is only used in tests should be in dev dependencies.
Packages, that is only used for code compilation should also be in
devDependencies.
